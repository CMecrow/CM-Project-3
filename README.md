# Tone Deaf Newcastle

As a developer I've been tasked with creating a program to aid in the running of the box office for a brand new music venue in Newcastle.

This project is written in Python with data stored on a Google worksheet.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are:
- To read and input to a data model (Google worksheet), which stores the essential information about each event, ie event name, capacity, sales and availability.
- Provide the user the ability to sell tickets for an event, should they be available, with those sales being updated on the Google worksheet.
- Provide the user the tools to create a brand new event and set a total capacity, which can then be sold and updated with the rest of the program.
- Provide the user the tools to create an up to date 'sales report', providing total capacity, sales and availability for each event.

## Project values

With these four pillars, the user could run a functioning box office, and the program is flexible enough to be developed and added to in the long term to fill any future needs of the business.

Because the program automates the selling of a ticket and the updating of records, it eliminates any room for human error that may occur. The last thing a music venue wants is to have a larger audience than they can host, running overcapacity. Because the availability for an event is based on the total entered capacity on event creation, minus any processed sales, the figure will always be correct, with validation included to stop the availability of an event from dropping below zero.

Though the venue may have a total set capacity, this may change from event to event, due to factors such as merchandise being sold in the venue, extra bar sale points or even just for public safety. The created event may even be happening outside the venue at a separate location. The program was made to be able to set any capacity with this in mind.

The creation of a new event is quick and easy, only requiring a title and capacity to be created. This is useful for those new events just announced or even for a last minute request for a VIP section!

To ease in the running of the events and also in the marketing and sales of the venue, it was a requirement that the program could create an up to date and instantly readable sales report.
